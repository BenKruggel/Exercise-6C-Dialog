Created independent side-quest type campaign featuring a 3rd person animated character with a non-default model, unique animations, item utilization and textures. Multiple interactable objects and large explorable terrain. Score and progress is constantly displayed and Inky dialogue NPC interaction clearly states the objective to the player. Custom background arts, music and sound effects. Fully functional menus. Many juicy features like custom sound effects and music, NPC interaction (both dialogue and reaction to being shot), hidden gameplay routes, secret endings and rewards for accomplishing goal, and interesting enemies and material textures.
